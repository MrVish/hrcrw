# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Implement consistent color-coded styling for Risk levels and Status indicators across Clients and Exceptions components to match the existing professional styling used in the Reviews component. Currently, the Reviews page displays beautiful color-coded status badges (green for approved, blue for submitted, gray for draft, etc.), while Clients and Exceptions use plain text or basic styling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want consistent visual styling for status and risk indicators across all components, so that I can quickly identify important information using familiar color patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Clients list THEN status indicators SHALL use the same color-coded badges as Reviews
2. WHEN viewing the Clients list THEN risk level indicators SHALL use intuitive color coding (green=low, orange=medium, red=high)
3. WHEN viewing the Exceptions list THEN status indicators SHALL use the same color-coded badges as Reviews
4. WHEN viewing the Exceptions list THEN priority indicators SHALL use risk-based color coding
5. WHEN viewing Client detail pages THEN all status and risk displays SHALL use consistent StatusBadge styling
6. WHEN viewing Exception detail pages THEN all status and priority displays SHALL use consistent StatusBadge styling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want risk levels to have intuitive color coding, so that I can immediately understand the severity level without reading the text.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a risk level is "Low" THEN it SHALL display with green color coding
2. WHEN a risk level is "Medium" THEN it SHALL display with orange color coding  
3. WHEN a risk level is "High" THEN it SHALL display with red color coding
4. WHEN a risk level is "Critical" THEN it SHALL display with dark red color coding
5. WHEN AML risk levels are displayed THEN they SHALL use the same color scheme as general risk levels

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized StatusBadge component that handles all status and risk styling, so that styling is consistent and maintainable across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the StatusBadge component is used THEN it SHALL support both status and risk type indicators
2. WHEN StatusBadge receives a "client" type THEN it SHALL apply appropriate colors for client statuses
3. WHEN StatusBadge receives an "exception" type THEN it SHALL apply appropriate colors for exception statuses  
4. WHEN StatusBadge receives a "risk" type THEN it SHALL apply risk-level color coding
5. WHEN StatusBadge is used THEN it SHALL maintain the same visual style as existing Review status badges

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want exception priorities to be visually distinct, so that I can quickly identify critical and high-priority exceptions that need immediate attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an exception priority is "Low" THEN it SHALL display with green color coding
2. WHEN an exception priority is "Medium" THEN it SHALL display with orange color coding
3. WHEN an exception priority is "High" THEN it SHALL display with red color coding  
4. WHEN an exception priority is "Critical" THEN it SHALL display with dark red color coding
5. WHEN viewing exception lists THEN priority badges SHALL be immediately distinguishable from status badges

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want client statuses to be visually consistent with review statuses, so that I have a familiar and intuitive interface experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client status is "Active" THEN it SHALL display with green color coding similar to "approved" reviews
2. WHEN a client status is "Inactive" THEN it SHALL display with gray color coding similar to "draft" reviews
3. WHEN a client status is "Suspended" THEN it SHALL display with red color coding
4. WHEN a client status is "Pending" THEN it SHALL display with orange color coding
5. WHEN client status badges are displayed THEN they SHALL have the same visual styling as review status badges
