# Exception API Alignment Requirements

## Introduction

The current exception system has a mismatch between frontend expectations and backend implementation. The frontend expects a comprehensive exception system with fields like title, priority, due_date, etc., while the backend only supports basic exception creation. This creates API compatibility issues and limits the functionality of the exception management system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend Exception Model Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend exception model to support comprehensive exception data, so that the frontend can create and manage detailed exceptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend exception model is updated THEN it SHALL include title, priority, due_date, and resolution_notes fields
2. WHEN creating an exception THEN the system SHALL accept all frontend exception fields
3. WHEN the exception enum is updated THEN it SHALL include DOCUMENTATION, COMPLIANCE, TECHNICAL, and OPERATIONAL types
4. WHEN the exception model is extended THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing data

### Requirement 2: API Endpoint Alignment

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent API endpoints for exception creation, so that the frontend can successfully create exceptions without format mismatches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend calls the exception creation endpoint THEN it SHALL accept a single exception object
2. WHEN the API receives exception data THEN it SHALL validate all required fields properly
3. WHEN an exception is created THEN the response SHALL include all exception details with user names
4. WHEN the API schema is updated THEN it SHALL support field aliases for backward compatibility

### Requirement 3: Database Migration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want seamless database migration for the enhanced exception model, so that existing data is preserved and new fields are properly added.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration runs THEN it SHALL add new fields without data loss
2. WHEN existing exceptions are migrated THEN they SHALL have default values for new fields
3. WHEN new enum values are added THEN they SHALL be available for use immediately
4. WHEN the migration completes THEN all constraints SHALL be properly applied

### Requirement 4: Frontend-Backend Data Mapping

**User Story:** As a user, I want the exception form to work seamlessly with the backend, so that I can create exceptions with all necessary details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend sends exception data THEN it SHALL map correctly to backend schema
2. WHEN the backend returns exception data THEN it SHALL include user names and related information
3. WHEN field names differ between frontend and backend THEN aliases SHALL handle the mapping
4. WHEN validation fails THEN clear error messages SHALL be returned to the frontend
